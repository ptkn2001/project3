- When they're in, they will see the dashboard, where there are the window summaries of total budget, budget left and hoe much they've spent. 
- In the dashboard, they will also have the access to the donut chart that displays the top 5 expenses and the report of the expenses.
- When they click on Category on the side bar, they will be able to choose, create or remove category. A updated list of categories will be shown after they click the button.
- When they click on Budget, they will be able to create monthly budget, add description, amount and choose the category.
- When they click on Expense, they will be able to add the description about the expense, the amount is spent and choose the category it falls into.
- When they click on Extra, they have access to extra services, such as browsing traveling and entertainment information. They can look for air tickets, restaurant locations and forecast weather in the destination.

Expense Management System is a place where users can track and manage their expenses based on personal goals. 

As a user, when I log in, I want to categorize my budget, manage my expenses,
so I can get the report of my expenses, and evaluate my budget.
